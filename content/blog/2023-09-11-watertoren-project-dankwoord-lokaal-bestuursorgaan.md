**Hieronder een dankwoord vanuit het lokale bestuursorgaan (Village Development Committee) van Sotokoi Tintinto n.a.v. het waterproject dat afgerond is in januari 2023.**

\-------------------------

Dear Our Philanthropist,



First and foremost,  my name is Modou Bah, the Secretary of Sotokoi Village Development Committee in Sotokoi Village in the West Coast Region of The Gambia. 



I write this email on behalf of the entire  Village of Sotokoi and the Village Development Committee (VDC) in particular to express our sincere and deepest gratitude and appreciation for the Water Supply that your Organisation provided our Village.  For the over 2000 people and 150 compounds that currently benefit from this clean and undisrupted water supply your organisation provided our Village, we are indeed very much grateful and we want to thank your organisation immensely. 



For the over 85yrs of the Village existence, we have never had such a support especially in terms of water supply,  thus, this support is highly valued and cherished.  We want to assure you that the management of the Borehole and all the Taps are in everyone's concern. We will maintain and take care of all the materials to see that we enjoy this water supply for a very long time. 



Once again, thank you and we look forward to your continuous visit and support to the Village. 



Best wishes, 

Modou Bah

Secretary Sotokoi Village Development Committee
